notes on variables:
- a variable name must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
- numbers may follow the above characters, but they cannot come first
- javascript is case sensitive
- no spaces in variable names
- camelCase is the best practice for naming variables with multiple words (helps with readability)

var, let, const:
- var: 'old' keyword for variables in javascript
- let: 'new' keyword introduced for variables in ES6
- const: unchangeable (ES6) variable once declared
*/

/*
declarations vs initialization:
- declarations are the LEFT side of an operator in a variable assignment (e.g. let x)
- initializations are on the the RIGHT side of an operator in a variable assignment (e.g. = 1)
*/

let x, y, z; // declaration
x = 1; // initialization≈í
y = 'hello'; // initialization
z = 3; // initialization

console.log(`x: ${x} | y: ${y} | z: ${z}`);
